// v19: Introduced IPluginSelf.  MIN bumped to 19.
// v20: Added OnBeforeWorldEndPlay / OnAfterWorldEndPlay.  MIN remains 19.
// v21: Added IPluginNativePointers.  MIN remains 19.
// v22: Added IPluginHttpServer (hooks->HttpServer).
//   Static file route registration (AddRoute/RemoveRoute), raw-request
//      filter hook (RegisterOnRawRequest/UnregisterOnRawRequest), and
//  raw-response route registration (AddRawRoute/RemoveRawRoute).
//      URL scheme: /<pluginName>/<routeName>/...  (case-insensitive).
//      Static files are served from <exe_dir>\Plugins\<pluginName>\<folderName>\.
//      Raw-response routes let plugins handle arbitrary URL prefixes and write
//      any response body + content-type directly (e.g. JSON API endpoints).
//   Server builds only; nullptr on client/generic builds.
//      MIN remains 19.
// v23 - SR Hotfix update 22/04/2026 118961
// v24: Added scaling/metrics functions to IModLoaderImGui (GetFontSize, GetTextLineHeight,
//      GetTextLineHeightWithSpacing, GetFrameHeight, GetFrameHeightWithSpacing, CalcTextSize,
//      SetWindowFontScale, GetContentRegionAvail, GetDisplaySize).
//      Added PluginWindowHints struct and windowHints field to PluginWidgetDesc.
//      MIN remains 23.
// v31: Added extra_window_flags to PluginWindowHints.
//      Allows plugins to pass additional ImGuiWindowFlags (e.g. NoTitleBar, NoResize).
//      0 = no extra flags (default behaviour unchanged). MIN remains 26.
// v32: Added IPluginClientSessionInfo (client only, null on server/generic).
//      Exposes GetSessionOnlineMode, IsMultiplayer, IsServer query functions.
// v33: Added pluginTarget field to PluginInfo. Every plugin must now declare
//      PLUGIN_TARGET_CLIENT or PLUGIN_TARGET_SERVER. The loader rejects plugins
//      that don't match the current build target.
// v34: Game had an update, needed interface bump
// v35: Added layout/sidebar functions to IModLoaderImGui:
//      BeginChild, EndChild, PushStyleColor, PopStyleColor,
//      PushStyleVarFloat, PushStyleVarVec2, PopStyleVar,
//      PushItemWidth, PopItemWidth, SetCursorPosX, GetCursorPosX,
//      BeginTable, TableNextColumn, EndTable, IsItemClicked,
//      GetWindowWidth, GetWindowHeight, Dummy.
//      Also wired SetWindowFontScale which was declared but not populated.
//      MIN remains 34.
//      -- Mass expansion of IModLoaderImGui — added ~100 additional ImGui
//      functions covering: window queries, scroll, groups, extended cursor
//      control, all drag/slider variants, listbox, tab bar, menus, popups,
//      tooltips, full table API, item state predicates, disabled regions,
//      clip rect, mouse queries, color utilities, and misc helpers.
//      MIN remains 34.
//      --- Added MakeTextKey to IPluginTextUtils (trampoline for FTextKey::FTextKey),
//      letting plugins build the Namespace/Key FTextKey arguments required by
//      AsLocalizable_Advanced.  MIN remains 34.
// v36: Replaced IPluginClientSessionInfo with IPluginNetModeInfo (server + client,
//      null on generic). The old offset-based UCrSessionSubsystem reads were
//      replaced with an AOB-resolved trampoline to AActor::InternalGetNetMode,
//      exposed via the new EPluginNetMode enum (mirrors engine ENetMode) so
//      plugins can compare against typed names instead of raw integers.
//      MIN should be bumped, but no one is using it yet.
//      --- Added object/package lookup address resolvers to IPluginEngineEvents:
//      GetStaticFindObjectByPathAddress, GetStaticFindObjectByNameAddress,
//      GetStaticFindObjectSafeByPathAddress, GetStaticFindObjectSafeByNameAddress,
//      GetStaticFindObjectFastAddress, GetFindPackageAddress,
//      GetPackageFullyLoadAddress, GetLoadPackageAddress,
//      GetAssetDataFastGetAssetAddress -- AOB-resolved during early modloader
//      startup (Hooks::ObjectLookup), exposed as raw trampoline addresses.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v37: Added IPluginImGuiTextures (client only, null on server/generic).
//      Lets plugins load images from file or memory (WIC: PNG/JPG/BMP/GIF/TIFF),
//      from raw RGBA pixels, or directly from a live SDK::UTexture2D*, and render
//      them via Image/ImageButton without any direct D3D12 access.
//      Up to 64 textures may be live at once.
//      hooks->ImGuiTextures->{LoadFromFile, LoadFromMemory, LoadFromRGBA,
//      LoadFromUTexture2D, FreeTexture, GetSize, Image, ImageButton}.
//      LoadFromUTexture2D copies the engine texture to a modloader-owned resource.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v38: IPluginImGuiTextures: raised texture slot cap 64 -> 2048.
//      Added GetFreeSlotCount(), GetCapacity().
//      Load functions now throw std::out_of_range when all slots are in use
//      (previously returned nullptr silently).
//      LoadFromUTexture2D now gates on FD3D12Resource::DefaultResourceState --
//      returns nullptr (without throwing) when streaming is still in flight.
//      Image/ImageButton silently skip rendering if the engine resource is not
//      yet in a shader-readable state (same check, re-evaluated each draw call).
//      MIN remains 34.
// v39: All Load* functions now take a mandatory name parameter (const char*).
//      The name is logged when the texture is rendered and on load errors to
//      make it easier to identify which texture is causing problems.
//      LoadFromUTexture2D now copies the engine texture to a modloader-owned
//      resource, so the handle survives engine GC/eviction.  Plugins must call
//      FreeTexture when done; handles are no longer auto-expired each frame.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v40: Added IPluginSplash (client only, null on server/generic).
//      Lets plugins push status messages and progress updates to the startup
//      splash window during PluginInit, giving users feedback when a plugin
//      takes several seconds to initialise.
//      hooks->Splash->{SetStatus, SetProgress, SetSubStatus, SetSubProgress, ClearSubBar}.
//      All text parameters are UTF-8 const char* (converted to wchar internally).
//      Safe to call from PluginInit; no-ops on server/generic builds.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v41: Added AcquireSplashHold / ReleaseSplashHold to IPluginSplash.
//      Lets plugins that PostToGameThread during PluginInit keep the splash
//      open until the async work completes.  Call AcquireSplashHold before
//      returning from PluginInit, then ReleaseSplashHold when the game-thread
//      callback finishes.  The init thread waits up to 30 s for all holds to
//      drain before closing the splash.  Safe to call from any thread.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v42: Needed version bump as game updated
// v43: Added IPluginUIEvents::RegisterOnPanelWindowClosed /
//      UnregisterOnPanelWindowClosed -- fires PluginPanelClosedCallback(handle)
//      when a panel window is closed, either via the ImGui titlebar X button
//      or via a plugin calling SetPanelClose.
//      Added IPluginUIEvents::AcquireInputCapture / ReleaseInputCapture --
//      lets any plugin request that the modloader suppress game mouse/
//      keyboard input (same as while a panel/modloader window is open),
//      independent of panel/widget state. Reference-counted via opaque
//      tokens; input stays suppressed until every acquired token is released.
//      MIN remains 42 (additive fields appended to IPluginUIEvents).
// v44: Added IPluginCraftingEvents (hooks->Crafting) -- RegisterOnCraftingFinished /
//      UnregisterOnCraftingFinished, fired by ACrCrafter::NativeOnItemCraftingComplete
//      (AOB-resolved native signal handler, not a UFUNCTION) whenever any crafting
//      building (Crafter, Forge, Refinery, Factory, Assembler, Exporter,
//      FoodProcessor, ItemPrinter, etc.) finishes crafting an item. Callback
//      receives the ACrCrafter* (as void*), its UCrCraftingComponent* (as void*,
//      may be null), and the crafter's FMassEntityHandle Index/SerialNumber.
//      Added CraftingFinished() to IPluginNativePointers (appended at end).
//      hooks->Crafting is appended at the end of IPluginHooks (not inserted
//      in the middle) to preserve struct layout for v42/v43 plugins.
//      MIN remains 42.
// v45: IPluginImGuiTextures texture slot cap raised 2048 -> 4096.
//      Textures are now shared and refcounted by name (case-insensitive):
//      if Load* is called with a name that matches an already-loaded,
//      in-use texture, the existing GPU resource is reused and its
//      refcount is incremented instead of creating a new copy. Each
//      successful Load* call must be paired with exactly one FreeTexture
//      call; the underlying resource is only released once the refcount
//      reaches zero. Plugins sharing a texture name must ensure the
//      underlying image data is identical -- the first registration wins.
//      MIN remains 42.
// v46: New game update, min/max bump
// v47: Added IPluginObjectWalker (hooks->ObjectWalker) -- walks SDK::UObject::
//      GObjects on demand and lets plugins find objects by class/object name
//      and invoke a UFunction on one by name via ProcessEvent. On-demand only
//      (every call walks tens of thousands of GObjects entries synchronously);
//      there is no hook into UObject construction, so nothing fires live as
//      objects spawn -- callers must trigger a walk and cache results.
//      InvokeUFunctionByName/InvokeResolvedUFunction perform no parameter
//      marshaling: paramsBuffer must already match the target UFunction's
//      native Params layout, since this SDK dump exposes no params-size field
//      to validate against. Appended at the end of IPluginHooks to preserve
//      layout for existing plugins. MIN remains 46.
//      --- Added IPluginDelegateHook (hooks->Delegate) -- lets a plugin
//      splice a synthetic UFunction into an existing UE5 multicast delegate
//      (e.g. SDK::UCrSaveSubsystem::OnAfterSave) and get a parameterless
//      callback when it broadcasts, without the maintainer hand-writing a
//      dedicated AOB-scanned hook module for it. Never touches a real
//      UClass's FuncMap/AllFunctionsCache, so other code resolving the same
//      function name by name is unaffected. Multiple concurrent hooks,
//      including several on the same delegate, are supported via opaque
//      DelegateHookHandle values. Appended at the end of IPluginHooks.
//      v47 is unreleased, so this and IPluginObjectWalker land in the same
//      version; MIN remains 46.
//      --- IPluginObjectWalker reworked while still unreleased (no plugins
//      built against the visitor-based shape yet): WalkAllObjects /
//      FindObjectsByClassName / FindObjectsByName replaced with *Into
//      variants that fill a plugin-owned PluginObjectInfo buffer instead of
//      invoking a callback -- no allocation crosses the DLL boundary in
//      either direction. Each takes a PluginObjectLookupMode to filter
//      CDOs/archetypes out of GObjects without the plugin needing to know
//      raw EObjectFlags bit values. Return value is the total match count
//      (may exceed capacity; caller can re-call with a bigger buffer if
//      truncated). FindFirstObjectByName/InvokeUFunctionByName/
//      ResolveUFunction/InvokeResolvedUFunction are unchanged.
//      --- Added IPluginObjectProperties (hooks->ObjectProperties) --
//      resolves a UPROPERTY/FProperty by class name + property name (walks
//      the live UClass's ChildProperties + SuperStruct chain), then reads/
//      writes it through typed accessors (Bool/Int/Float/Object) or a raw
//      escape hatch (GetPropertyRawPtr). Because FProperty::Offset is looked
//      up fresh against the running build's reflection metadata every call,
//      a game update that reshuffles struct layout does not require
//      touching any plugin that goes through this interface instead of
//      casting raw SDK structs and reading at a compiled-in offset -- only
//      the property *name* needs to stay the same.
//      String/Name properties are read-only (FString/FName own their own
//      backing storage; writing one in place safely needs the engine's own
//      allocator, out of scope here). Does not cover plain native C++
//      members with no UPROPERTY/FProperty entry -- those have no reflection
//      metadata to look up by name. v47 is unreleased, so this lands in the
//      same version as IPluginObjectWalker/IPluginDelegateHook above.
//      Appended at the end of IPluginHooks. MIN remains 46.
// v48: Added ImDrawList direct-drawing access to IModLoaderImGui (appended at
//      the end of the struct, so existing v34+ plugins keep working unchanged).
//      GetWindowDrawList/GetBackgroundDrawList/GetForegroundDrawList return an
//      opaque PluginDrawList (== ImDrawList*) handle valid for the current
//      frame only -- do not cache it across frames. Covers shape primitives
//      (Line, Rect(Filled), RectFilledMultiColor, Quad(Filled),
//      Triangle(Filled), Circle(Filled), Ngon(Filled), Ellipse(Filled),
//      Text/TextSized, Polyline, ConvexPolyFilled, BezierCubic/Quadratic),
//      images via existing PluginTextureHandle (Image, ImageQuad,
//      ImageRounded), the stateful Path* builder API (PathClear/LineTo/ArcTo/
//      ArcToFast/EllipticalArcTo/BezierCubicCurveTo/BezierQuadraticCurveTo/
//      Rect/FillConvex/Stroke), and draw-list-local clip rect stack
//      (PushClipRect/PushClipRectFullScreen/PopClipRect/GetClipRectMin/Max).
//      Colors are packed 0xAABBGGRR ImU32 -- build them with the existing
//      GetColorU32FromVec4/GetColorU32FromCol helpers. MIN remains 46.
// v49: IPluginUIEvents::RegisterOnConfigChanged/UnregisterOnConfigChanged now
//      take a leading `const IPluginSelf* self` parameter, matching the
//      self-first convention already used by IPluginLogger/IPluginConfig.
//      self is the same pointer received in PluginInit -- pass it straight
//      through, no plugin-name string needed. The modloader uses it to scope
//      FireConfigChanged so a plugin's callback only fires for edits to its
//      own config file, instead of broadcasting every plugin's config
//      changes to every registered listener. Breaking signature change:
//      MIN bumped to 49.

// v50 - 29/07/2026: Added IPluginDebugDraw, reachable as hooks->HUD->DebugDraw
//      (client only -- the whole HUD interface is null on server/generic).
//      Reimplements all sixteen UKismetSystemLibrary::DrawDebug* nodes, which
//      are dead on this shipping build: ENABLE_DRAW_DEBUG is 0, so every body
//      compiled away to nothing and only the exec thunks survive, parsing
//      their parameters off the FFrame and returning without drawing. The
//      DrawDebugType pin on the trace nodes is inert for the same reason. What
//      is still alive is the renderer -- UWorld::LineBatchers[4] (all four
//      NewObject'd and registered by UWorld::UpdateWorldComponents) and
//      ULineBatchComponent::DrawLines -- so this builds the same geometry and
//      hands it to the engine's own batchers via a new AOB-scanned hook module
//      (hooks/game/debug_draw/).
//      Covers Line, Point, Circle, Sphere, Box, Capsule, Cylinder,
//      ConeInDegrees, Arrow, CoordinateSystem, Plane, Frustum, Camera (both an
//      ACameraActor* form and a location/rotation/FOV form), String,
//      FloatHistoryTransform and FloatHistoryLocation, plus FlushPersistentLines
//      and ClearAllStrings.
//      DrawString takes a trailing fontScale (1.0f = the engine's small font at
//      native size; the engine applies it with no distance falloff). Added
//      while v50 was still unreleased, so the signature was amended in place
//      rather than appending a second function -- no plugin has been built
//      against the earlier shape.
//      Two primitives deviate from the engine because only DrawLines survived
//      as an out-of-line function: DrawPoint (engine uses BatchedPoints) is a
//      three-axis cross, and DrawPlane / the float-history graphs (engine uses
//      BatchedMeshes) draw outlines instead of filled quads.
//      Callable from any thread: the batchers are game-thread only, but the
//      wrappers copy every argument and defer to GameThreadDispatch when the
//      caller is elsewhere, so drawing from an ImGui panel callback (which
//      runs on the render thread) just works.
//      The new field is appended at the end of IPluginHUDEvents and all the
//      geometry structs are new, so nothing existing shifts: MIN remains 49.

// v51: Added IPluginUIEvents::AcquireInputPassthrough / ReleaseInputPassthrough
//      -- a cooperative counterpart to the v43 AcquireInputCapture pair.
//      AcquireInputCapture is all-or-nothing: while a token is held the game
//      receives no mouse or keyboard input at all. That is right for a modal
//      settings panel and wrong for an always-on widget UI the player is meant
//      to keep playing underneath (a timeline editor, a build planner, an
//      overlay with draggable handles) -- those currently freeze the player out
//      until the window is closed. A passthrough token instead puts the
//      modloader in cooperative mode: ImGui is fed every message and draws and
//      owns the cursor exactly as before, but the game is only cut out of the
//      input classes ImGui actually wants that frame -- mouse while the cursor
//      is over an ImGui window or dragging a widget (io.WantCaptureMouse), and
//      keyboard while a text field has focus (io.WantCaptureKeyboard /
//      WantTextInput). Everything else, including the WM_INPUT raw-mouse deltas
//      UE5 uses for camera look, reaches the game untouched.
//      Exclusive capture always wins: while any modloader window, plugin panel
//      or v43 capture token is active, passthrough tokens have no effect and
//      behaviour is exactly what it was before. Tokens are refcounted across
//      all plugins the same way, and must be released in PluginShutdown.
//      Appended at the end of IPluginUIEvents, so nothing existing shifts:
//      MIN remains 49.

// v52: Added IModLoaderImGui::GetMouseWheel / GetMouseWheelH. The v36 mouse
//      query block covers buttons, position, dragging and hovering but never
//      exposed the wheel, so a plugin drawing its own scrollable or zoomable
//      surface (a timeline, a map, a graph) had no way to read it at all --
//      ImGui consumes the WM_MOUSEWHEEL itself and the plugin never sees the
//      message. Both return the per-frame delta straight off ImGuiIO, in the
//      usual ImGui units (one notch = 1.0). Appended at the end of the
//      function table, which is append-only: MIN remains 49.

// v53: IPluginNetworkChannel now works on a listen host (a client build that is
//      hosting the session).  Previously SendPacketToClient, SendPacketToAllClients,
//      RegisterServerMessageHandler and ExcludeFromBroadcast were compiled as
//      unconditional no-ops on client builds, so a listen host could not talk to
//      its own clients at all -- only a dedicated server build could.  Authority is
//      a runtime property, not a build-time one, so all four are now real on client
//      builds and gated per call on the net mode (ListenServer or DedicatedServer).
//
//      Behaviour change, no layout change: IsServer() now reports net authority
//      rather than "was this the server build". It was hardcoded false on client
//      builds; it returns true on a listen host and stays false on a pure client
//      and in Standalone. This is the point of the change -- the natural guard
//      `if (Network->IsServer()) Broadcast(...)` starts working on a listen host
//      without touching plugin code. A plugin that used IsServer() to ask which
//      DLL it was loaded into should use PluginInfo::pluginTarget instead, or
//      hooks->NetMode->GetNetMode() for the full four-way answer.
//
//      On a listen host both send functions skip the host's own player controller:
//      an RPC aimed at it executes in-process rather than going over the wire, so
//      it would loop back into this same process's client handlers (and arrive
//      twice). "All clients" means all remote clients on both builds. Host-side
//      code already holds the authoritative data and can call its own handler
//      directly. No struct changed: MIN remains 49.

// v54: Plugin networking moved onto the Unreal control channel and the previous
//      transport was DELETED, not deprecated. Envelopes used to ride two game
//      RPCs -- ClientSaveStringToTxt (server->client) and ServerExecuteConsoleCommand
//      (client->server); both hooks are gone. IPluginNetworkChannel is unchanged
//      in shape and every function behaves the same from a plugin's point of view.
//
//      Two consequences plugins can observe:
//
//      - IPluginNativePointers::ClientMessageExec is now ALWAYS nullptr, on every
//        build, because the hook it exposed no longer exists. The field is kept so
//        the struct layout does not shift under already-built plugins. Nothing
//        else in that struct moved.
//
//      - There is no fallback transport and no capability negotiation, and one
//        cannot be added: asking a peer whether it speaks the wire would itself
//        have to travel over the wire. Sending to a peer whose loader lacks a
//        working control channel does not degrade -- the engine closes that
//        connection on an unrecognised control message. Every peer in a session
//        must therefore run a loader whose control-channel patterns resolved --
//        which is why those patterns are REQUIRED at preflight: a game update
//        that moves one disables the entire mod loader rather than starting a
//        session where networked plugins are silently inert. Plugins do not need
//        to handle a "networking unavailable" state, because there is no build
//        in which the loader runs without it.
//
//      No struct changed: MIN remains 49.

// v55: Server->client sends are now gated on a client plugin manifest. A joining
//      client reports every plugin it has loaded, with versions; the authority
//      records that per connection and delivers a packet from plugin P version V
//      only to clients that reported P at exactly V.
//
//      No signature changed -- SendPacketToClient and SendPacketToAllClients
//      already took `const IPluginSelf* self`, which carries both name and
//      version, so the loader could already attribute every packet to its sender.
//
//      What changed for plugin authors, and it is worth reading twice:
//
//      - SendPacketToAllClients no longer means "every client". It means every
//        client that has your plugin at your exact version. A version bump on one
//        side silently stops delivery between the two -- which is the point, since
//        two builds disagreeing about their own packet layout is the failure this
//        prevents, but it will look like the network dropped your packet.
//        Skipped clients are logged at Debug/Trace naming the plugin and version.
//
//      - A client that has not (yet) reported receives nothing. A manifest is sent
//        at world begin play and retried before the client's first outgoing
//        packet, so there is a window early in a join where a broadcast reaches
//        nobody. Send state on request, or after your own client-ready signal,
//        rather than assuming a broadcast at join lands.
//
//      - This is also a safety improvement: a client not running the loader can
//        never report, so it can never be sent a control bunch, so it can no
//        longer be disconnected by one (see v54).
//
//      Operators can inspect all of this with the `clients` console command.
//      No struct changed: MIN remains 49.

// v56 (2026-08-05): Handshake before the wire, and a client-ready signal.
//
//      THE BUG THIS FIXES: a client sent its manifest the moment it had a world,
//      unprompted. On a server not running the loader that control bunch is an
//      unrecognised message type, and the engine's response to one is to close
//      the connection (ControlChannelMessageUnknown). Joining a vanilla server
//      with the loader installed therefore disconnected you.
//
//      v54 claimed capability negotiation was impossible. That was true only
//      IN-BAND: a probe sent as a control bunch is the very thing that kills a
//      vanilla peer. Out of band it works fine. The authority now greets each
//      joining client through APlayerController::ClientMessage -- an ordinary
//      replicated engine RPC, which a client without the loader hands to a
//      viewport console that shipping builds never create, so it does nothing at
//      all there. Nothing is put on the control channel in either direction until
//      that greeting has been seen, so no peer can be disconnected by us again.
//
//      Plugins do not see the handshake. What they see is that a client is now
//      "ready" at a defined moment, and that moment is LATER than player-join:
//
//      - IsClientReady(pc, self) is exactly the predicate SendPacketToClient
//        gates on -- that client reported YOUR plugin at YOUR version. It is
//        false during the join window even for a client that will be ready a
//        moment later.
//
//      - RegisterClientReadyCallback fires once per client, per plugin, when that
//        becomes true. Send join-time state from there, NOT from a player-joined
//        hook: a packet sent at PostLogin is dropped, because the client has not
//        reported yet. Registering late is safe -- the callback fires immediately
//        for every client already ready, so a hot-reloaded plugin still learns
//        about the clients already in the session.
//
//      - IsServerReady / RegisterServerReadyCallback are the client-side mirror:
//        true once the authority has acknowledged our manifest, which is the
//        point from which SendPacketToServer can actually arrive. The callback
//        carries the authority's loader build tag.
//
//      The loader deliberately does NOT buffer and replay packets sent before a
//      peer is ready. It cannot: payloads are opaque bytes, so it cannot tell a
//      stale position update (worse than useless when replayed three seconds
//      late) from state that is still valid. Sends to a peer that is not ready
//      are dropped, and now warn once per plugin per connection instead of
//      logging at Debug -- if you see that warning, move the send into the ready
//      callback.
//

// v62 (2026-09-02): AOB scanning moved into its own load phase, and out of
//      IPluginSelf. BREAKING -- MIN and MAX both move to 62.
//
//      THE PROBLEM: a plugin resolved its patterns from PluginInit, which runs
//      long after the loader finished its own preflight and installed its own
//      hooks. A plugin whose AOB stopped matching after a game update therefore
//      loaded anyway, then either did nothing or wrote a detour over whatever
//      now lived at the address it guessed. The loader had no idea, and neither
//      did the user, until something behaved strangely mid-session.
//
//      WHAT CHANGED:
//
//      - IPluginSelf::scanner is GONE, and so is IPluginScanner. This is the
//        breaking part: a plugin built against v61 reads self->hooks out of
//        what is now a shorter struct. Every plugin must be rebuilt.
//
//      - New optional export OnPluginLoadHooks(IPluginSelf*, IPluginHookScanner*)
//        (PLUGIN_LOAD_HOOKS_FUNC_NAME). It runs after GetPluginInfo and before
//        PluginInit, and the IPluginHookScanner it is handed is the only way to
//        pattern scan. That table refuses calls made outside the event, so
//        stashing it does not buy a plugin its old behaviour back.
//
//      - Resolve* names each address. ANY MISS REFUSES THE PLUGIN -- one is
//        enough, and required vs optional does not change that. The loader
//        skips PluginInit, frees the DLL, and adds the miss to a report shown
//        in a popup (client) and by the hookfailures console command (both),
//        with a copy-to-clipboard button so a user can hand a plugin author
//        something actionable.
//
//        ResolveOptional / ReportWarning still exist and still mean something
//        to the plugin -- optional is the resolve whose null return the plugin
//        is expected to handle rather than assume -- but they are a LABEL on
//        the report, not a lighter verdict. A plugin that asked the loader for
//        an address and did not get it is a plugin running against a build it
//        was not made for, and which half of it still works is not a question
//        the loader (or the user staring at the game) can answer.
//
//      - self->hooks is null for the duration of the event, on purpose. A
//        plugin that misses a pattern is unloaded, so anything it registered or
//        detoured during the event would be left pointing into a freed module.
//        Resolve in the event, install in PluginInit.


// v63 (2026-09-04): Added IPluginConsole (hooks->Console) -- ModConsole command
//      registration and output sinks, on every build. Purely additive: the
//      field is appended at the end of IPluginHooks and nothing existing
//      shifts, so MIN remains 62.
//
//      ModConsole is the loader's own command registry -- one registry, two
//      front-ends (the ImGui developer console on client builds, the -console
//      window on any build). It was internal, so a plugin had no way to add a
//      command to either, and no way to get text back out of one: every engine
//      console function on a dedicated server returns void, and the only
//      text-returning path (APlayerController::ConsoleCommand) is client-only.
//
//      RegisterCommand adds a named command, with aliases, usage/help text for
//      `help`, an opaque userData, and a gameThread flag that makes the loader
//      run the handler on the next engine tick instead of on whichever console
//      thread typed it -- set it for anything touching engine state.
//
//      A handler is handed an opaque PluginConsoleSink and writes through
//      Write/Printf/Clear. Output is line-oriented and typed (Output / Notice /
//      Error) so the front-end can colour it, and the same command prints the
//      same lines wherever it was typed.
//
//      Execute runs any command line -- yours, another plugin's, or a built-in
//      -- and delivers its output to your own callback instead of to a console
//      window, which is what makes a command's result available to something
//      that is not a person looking at a screen (an RCON bridge, an HTTP
//      route). It returns false if the first token is not a registered command.
//
//      Three rules, each of which is a crash the loader had to make impossible:
//
//      - A sink is valid ONLY inside the call it was handed to. Do not stash it
//        and write from a thread later: the front-end owns it, and by then it
//        may be gone. Writes through a stale sink are dropped with a log line.
//
//      - Unregister in PluginShutdown. Handler addresses point into your
//        module; the loader drops every command a plugin owns before freeing
//        it and re-validates a queued gameThread handler before calling it,
//        but a command that outlives its DLL is not a state worth reaching.
//
//      - Output can arrive on the game thread. A gameThread command's handler,
//        and the Execute callbacks for one, run on a later tick, from a
//        different thread than the one that called Execute. Both must be
//        thread-safe, and userData must outlive the call.
//
//      Names are case-insensitive and global. RegisterCommand returns false
//      rather than shadowing a built-in or another plugin's command, so check
//      it -- and prefix anything generic with your plugin's name.

// v64 (2026-09-07): Added IPluginGameMenu (hooks->GameMenu) -- rows in the
//      game's own main menu and pause menu. Client only; nullptr on
//      server/generic builds, so null-check it.
//
//      The loader registers one of these itself: MOD LOADER, between OPTIONS
//      and CREDITS, opening the overlay. AddEntry puts yours next to it.
//
//      MIN stays at 63. IPluginGameMenu is a new pointer appended to the end
//      of IPluginHooks, so nothing a v63 plugin reads by offset moved, and a
//      v63 plugin that never looks at the new field is unaffected.
//
//      Three things worth knowing before you use it:
//
//      - onClick runs on the game thread, inside the menu widget's click
//        handler. Do not block in it. Opening a window or setting a flag is
//        the shape this is for.
//
//      - Remove your entries in PluginShutdown. The callback is an address in
//        your module; the loader drops a plugin's entries before freeing it
//        and re-checks that the address is still in a loaded module before
//        calling it, but neither of those is a reason to leave one behind.
//
//      - IsAvailable() can be false. The injection rests on two AOB patterns,
//        and a game update can move them. That is not fatal to the loader --
//        it just means no rows appear -- so a plugin whose only UI entry point
//        is a menu row should check, and offer a keybind as well.
// v65 - Game update
// v66 - Game Update

// v67 (2026-09-19): Added IPluginPak (hooks->Pak) -- runtime pak mounting and
//      asset loading, on every build. Purely additive: the pointer is appended
//      at the end of IPluginHooks and nothing existing shifts, so MIN remains
//      66. See PakLoading.md for the full guide.
//
//      WHAT IT DOES: mounts a .pak (and the .utoc/.ucas IoStore container that
//      sits next to it, when there is one) into the running engine through the
//      same entry point the engine's own chunk downloader uses --
//      FPakPlatformFile::HandleMountPakDelegate, which is what
//      FCoreDelegates::MountPak is bound to -- and unmounts it again through
//      its partner. Three AOB patterns, identical in both binaries, and all
//      optional at preflight: IsAvailable() is false when one is missing and
//      every mount call then returns PLUGIN_PAK_UNAVAILABLE.
//
//      IoStore, not just paks: this game ships cooked content as IoStore
//      containers, and the UE5 package loader only finds packages through the
//      package store. A bare .pak with .uasset files inside mounts fine and
//      is useless -- LoadObject will not find anything in it. Cook mods as
//      IoStore (the .pak/.utoc/.ucas triplet, same base name) and keep the
//      three files together; the engine opens the .utoc by changing the
//      pak's extension. The pak's own file index still serves loose files
//      (ini, txt, anything not a package), so a legacy pak is not rejected.
//
//      Three ways in, one registry:
//        MountFile     -- a pak on disk (absolute, or relative to your plugin's
//                         folder under Plugins\<name>\).
//        MountMemory   -- a pak (and optional container) you already hold in
//                         memory. The engine can only read paks through its
//                         file layer, so the bytes are written to
//                         ModLoader\PakCache\<plugin>\<name>.* first and
//                         mounted from there; a content hash sidecar skips the
//                         write when the cache already matches.
//        MountResource -- the same, sourced from RCDATA resources in your own
//                         DLL, so a plugin can ship as one file.
//
//      The registry is what stops a pak being mounted twice. Mounting a path
//      the engine already has -- by you, by another plugin, by a plugin that
//      has since been unloaded, or by the game at startup (~mods, LogicMods)
//      -- returns PLUGIN_PAK_ALREADY_MOUNTED with the existing handle, which
//      is a success, and adopts an orphaned mount as yours. Nothing is mounted
//      a second time, because the engine would happily do that and serve
//      whichever copy sorted first.
//
//      Unmount is real but not safe by construction. The engine drops the pak
//      and its container, but cannot un-load objects already created from its
//      packages: they stay alive with their bulk data (texture mips, audio,
//      streamed mesh LODs) now unreachable, and the next streaming request
//      into them is undefined behaviour. The loader cannot see which live
//      objects came from which container, so it does not try to decide for
//      you. Unmount when nothing you loaded from the pak is still referenced
//      -- typically between sessions, never with actors from it in the world.
//      Plugin unload does NOT unmount: the pak stays, its record is marked
//      orphaned, and a later mount of the same path adopts it. The console's
//      `pak unmount` is the operator's override.
//
//      Mounting runs on the game thread. From PluginInit (main thread parked)
//      or a game-thread callback the call is direct; from any other thread
//      it is queued to the next tick and waited on, and PLUGIN_PAK_TIMEOUT
//      means the request is still queued, not that it failed.
//
//      Order: paks are searched highest order first. The engine derives an
//      order from the path -- 3 for a pak under Content/Paks, 0 for anywhere
//      else -- so a pak mounted from a plugin folder with the engine default
//      would lose every file collision to the game's own paks.
//      PLUGIN_PAK_ORDER_DEFAULT therefore means 100, above every stock pak,
//      matching the engine's own "_P" patch-pak convention. Pass an explicit
//      value to sit elsewhere.
//
//      Asset helpers: LoadObject / LoadClass wrap StaticLoadObject so a plugin
//      does not have to build the call itself; SpawnActor spawns a class at a
//      location through UGameplayStatics. All three are game-thread only and
//      obey the same dispatch rule as mounting.
//
//      ModActor: PluginPakMountOptions::modActorClass names a Blueprint class
//      (e.g. "/Game/Mods/MyMod/ModActor.ModActor_C") the loader spawns in
//      every world that begins play while the pak is mounted -- the UE4SS
//      BPModLoader convention, so a Blueprint mod authored for that loader
//      works under this one unchanged. PreBeginPlay is called on the actor
//      before its BeginPlay and PostBeginPlay after, when the class defines
//      them. onModActorSpawned lets the plugin take the actor from there.

// v68: Typed and unique pattern scanning.
//      Added PluginScanKind, PluginScanFlags, PluginScanRequest and
//      IPluginHookScanner::Resolve (appended at the BOTTOM of the struct, so
//      the offset of every existing member is unchanged and MIN stays at 66).
//
//      BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, and it applies to plugins built against older
//      headers too, because it lives in the loader rather than the ABI:
//
//        * A pattern must now match EXACTLY ONCE in the image. Two matches
//          refuses the plugin. Previously the first match won, silently, and
//          was then memoized into scan_cache.ini -- so a pattern that stopped
//          being unique after a game update resolved to whichever copy sat at
//          the lower address, on every launch, with no symptom until something
//          behaved strangely mid-session.
//
//        * Resolve() additionally checks that the address IS what the caller
//          declared: a function entry, an address inside a function, code,
//          data, or a vtable. A pattern that resolves into the middle of an
//          unrelated function is refused, and the failure report says which
//          function and by how many bytes.
//
//      The pre-existing ResolveRequired/ResolveOptional/ResolveRequiredUnique
//      entry points still work and still compile unchanged. They scan with
//      kind PLUGIN_SCAN_ANY -- uniqueness is enforced for them, the structural
//      check is not -- and the failure report labels them unvalidated. Prefer
//      Resolve() for anything new: PLUGIN_SCAN_UNSPECIFIED is deliberately 0 so
//      a request that forgets to declare a kind is refused with a message
//      saying so, rather than defaulting into the weakest check.
//
// v69 (2026-09-24): Added IPluginConsole::ExecuteWithEngine (appended at the
//      BOTTOM of IPluginConsole, so nothing a v66-v68 plugin reads by offset
//      moved and MIN stays at 66).
//
//      Execute only runs registered commands and returns false for anything
//      else, so a plugin bridging a remote console (RCON, an HTTP route) had
//      to either keep a command table of its own or give up on engine
//      commands -- cvars, `log`, the CrRepGraph.* / Net.* families. The
//      fallthrough to the engine existed, but only inside the two front-ends.
//
//      ExecuteWithEngine takes a line exactly as a person would type it into
//      the -console window: mod loader and plugin commands first, the engine
//      for anything else, a leading '!' for engine-only. Every command it runs
//      -- registry or engine, whatever that command's own gameThread flag says
//      -- runs on the game thread, so both callbacks always fire from there.
//
//      Execute is unchanged. A v63 plugin may rely on its false return meaning
//      "not a registered command", and turning that into "ran it on the
//      engine" would change what the plugin does without it being rebuilt.
//
// v70 (2026-10-05): Mouse wheel input, and FreeTexture made safe to call at
//      any time. Both reported by a plugin author building a client plugin
//      that zooms with the wheel and creates textures at runtime.
//
//      Added PluginWheelModifiers, PluginMouseWheelEvent,
//      PluginMouseWheelCallback and IPluginInputEvents::RegisterMouseWheel /
//      UnregisterMouseWheel (appended at the BOTTOM of IPluginInputEvents, so
//      nothing a v66-v69 plugin reads by offset moved and MIN stays at 66).
//      Before this, a plugin had no way to see the wheel during gameplay:
//      GetMouseWheel reads ImGuiIO, which is only fed the mouse while a window
//      has exclusive capture, and keybinds have no wheel keys and cannot
//      consume. The one workaround was subclassing the game window.
//
//      BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, loader-side, so it applies to plugins built against
//      older headers too: FreeTexture no longer destroys the texture
//      immediately. It retires it -- the handle stops drawing at once, and the
//      resource and descriptor slot are released only after the GPU has
//      finished every frame that could have drawn them. Destroying on the spot
//      raced the render thread: a game-thread FreeTexture between a render
//      callback recording the descriptor and that frame's GPU work completing
//      released a resource the command list still used (or let a Load* rewrite
//      the SRV under it), and the GPU faulted. No plugin can tell the
//      difference except that the crash is gone and a freed slot becomes
//      reusable a frame or two later.

// (see PLUGIN_LOAD_HOOKS_FUNC_NAME at the bottom of this header) and is valid
// only for the duration of that call. Every function takes the same self the
// event was called with, and the loader rejects the call -- returning 0 and
// logging an error -- if that plugin has no scan session open. Stashing the
// table pointer and scanning later therefore does not work, by design: the
// loader has to know that every AOB a plugin depends on resolved BEFORE it
// decides whether to run PluginInit at all.
//
// Resolve* records the outcome under hookName, which is what the failure report
// and the log show the user -- name it after the thing being hooked
// ("UCrCraftingComponent::FinishCrafting"), not after the pattern.
//
// A MISS REFUSES THE PLUGIN, required or optional, and one is enough:
// PluginInit is never called, the DLL is freed, and every miss is listed in the
// failure window.
//
// SO DOES A SECOND MATCH (v68). A pattern that matches more than once has not
// resolved to an address, it has resolved to a coin flip -- the old behaviour
// took whichever copy sat lower in the image and then cached that offset, so
// nothing ever looked wrong. The failure report lists every match with the
// function each one landed in, which is what it takes to fix the pattern.
//
// AND SO DOES LANDING ON THE WRONG KIND OF THING, for calls made through
// Resolve() with a PluginScanKind declared. See PluginScanRequest below.
//
// The two flavours differ only in the label the report shows:
//
//   Required -- this plugin cannot work without the address.
//   Optional -- the plugin handles a null return rather than assuming one, so
//               it will not fault on it. It still does not load: an address
//               that stopped resolving means this build of the plugin does not
//               match this build of the game, and neither the loader nor the
//               user can tell which parts of it are still doing what they think.
//
// So resolve everything you intend to use, and mark optional only what your own
// code genuinely null-checks -- it makes the report readable for whoever has to
// fix it, and it keeps the plugin from faulting inside the event itself.
//
// RESOLVE ONLY -- DO NOT INSTALL. OnPluginLoadHooks runs before the plugin is
// committed to, and the loader frees the DLL when any pattern misses. A detour
// written into game code during this event would then be a jump into a freed
// module. Store the addresses in your own statics here and install from
// PluginInit, which only runs once every pattern resolved. That is also why
// self->hooks is null for the duration of the event.

// Interface for loading and rendering images without direct D3D12 access.
// Retrieved via hooks->ImGuiTextures (client only; nullptr on server/generic).
//
// THREADING RULES
// ---------------
// Load* functions perform a blocking GPU copy and MUST be called from a game-
// thread callback (OnExperienceLoadComplete, OnWorldBeginPlay, PluginInit, etc.)
// -- NOT from inside an ImGui render callback.  Calling them from the render
// thread blocks the GPU pipeline and will cause crashes with Streamline/DLSS.
//
// Typical usage pattern:
//   OnExperienceLoadComplete  ->  handle = LoadFromUTexture2D(tex, "MyTex")
//   ImGui render callback     ->  Image(handle, w, h)
//   PluginShutdown            ->  FreeTexture(handle)
//
// Image/ImageButton must be called from inside a plugin render callback while
// an ImGui frame is in progress.
//
// FreeTexture may be called from any thread at any time, including from a
// render callback that drew the same texture this frame (v70). It retires the
// texture: the handle is dead immediately (drawing it is a silent no-op), and
// the loader keeps the GPU resource and its descriptor slot alive until every
// frame that could have drawn it has finished on the GPU, then releases them.
// Before v70 FreeTexture destroyed the resource on the spot, which could crash
// the GPU if a frame already recorded with it had not been submitted yet.
//
// Up to GetCapacity() textures may be live at once. A retiring texture still
// occupies its slot for a frame or two, so GetFreeSlotCount does not count it.
// All Load* functions take a mandatory name parameter for log identification.
// They throw std::out_of_range if no slots are available.
// They return NULL (without throwing) only when D3D12 is not yet ready or
// when the specific resource cannot be loaded (bad file, null pointer, etc.).
// Call GetFreeSlotCount() before loading if you need to avoid the exception.
//
// Sharing/refcounting (v45): the name is also used as a sharing key
// (case-insensitive). If any Load* call is made with a name that matches an
// already-loaded, in-use texture, the existing GPU resource is reused and its
// refcount is incremented -- no new slot is consumed and no new GPU work is
// done. Every successful Load* call (whether it created a new texture or
// reused an existing one) must be paired with exactly one FreeTexture call;
// the underlying resource is only released once the refcount drops to zero.
// If multiple plugins use the same name, they must be referring to the same
// image -- the first registration's pixel data wins.

// dead on shipping builds: ENABLE_DRAW_DEBUG is 0, so all sixteen bodies
// compiled away to nothing and only the exec thunks remain (they parse their
// parameters off the stack and return). The DrawDebugType pin on the trace
// nodes is inert for the same reason. What survives is the renderer --
// UWorld::LineBatchers and ULineBatchComponent::DrawLines -- so these
// functions build the same geometry and feed it to the engine's own batchers.
//
// THREADING: safe to call from any thread. The line batchers are UObjects and
// can only be touched on the game thread, but you do not have to arrange that
// -- the modloader converts your arguments to owned values up front and then
// either draws inline (if you were already on the game thread) or defers by a
// single frame. This matters because ImGui panel and widget callbacks run on
// the render thread, and those are the most natural place to want to draw.
//
// Nothing you pass is retained past the call, including the float-history
// sample array (it is deep-copied). The exception is actor pointers --
// DrawCamera's camera actor and DrawString's base actor -- which must stay
// valid for the frame.
//
// LIFETIME: style->duration <= 0 draws for a single frame. A positive duration
// (or style->bPersistent) routes into the persistent batcher, which survives
// the per-frame flush -- FlushPersistentLines clears it. This mirrors the
// engine's own GetDebugLineBatcher/GetDebugLineLifeTime rules.

// AllFunctionsCache is ever touched, so nothing else that resolves the same
