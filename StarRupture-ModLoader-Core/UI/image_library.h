// The image library's table: which game images plugins have asked for, their
// state, what is kept in memory and in what order the rest are read.
//
// No engine and no GPU here. The pump that reads images, and the code that
// turns an item name into a texture path, call the members marked "pump" below
// and hand back what they made. That keeps every rule here testable with fakes.
//
// Threads. Item, Path, Get, State, UseSets and ForgetPlugin can be called from
// any thread. Get and State take no lock: they read per-image atomics from a
// table that never moves. Everything the pump calls takes the table's mutex,
// which no reader waits on.
