// The image library's lookups: an item's unique name (or the name of its data
// asset) to the object path of its icon, a building's asset name to the object path of its icon, and a live
// texture to the object path the pump reads it under.
//
// Everything that touches the engine is behind ItemSource and TextureEngine, so
// the rules here (the item index and its budget per tick, the images that count
// as no image, the texture cache and its invalidation) are testable with
// fakes. The loader's own sources are in image_lookup_host.cpp.
//
// Game thread only. Nothing here keeps a pointer into the engine: an item is
// read, and a texture is looked at, inside one call.
