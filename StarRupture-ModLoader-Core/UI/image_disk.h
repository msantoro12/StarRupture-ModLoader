// Saves the image library's stored copies to disk. The pump tells the saver when a shrink
// has started; the shrink's command list also copied the finished pixels into a readback
// buffer, and the saver polls for them each tick. A finished copy becomes a job for the
// worker (image_cache_writer.h), which writes the file. The list of images in each set is
// written the same way when it changes.
//
// The read side (Source, below) is a worker that finds out which files the folder holds, reads
// and checks a file, and uploads its pixels on a copy queue of its own (image_cache_reader.h).
// The pump asks it first for every image and falls back to the game when a file is missing,
// rejected or cannot be uploaded.
//
// Game thread only. No file I/O here: everything that touches the disk is a Job or the reader's.
