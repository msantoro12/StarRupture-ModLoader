// Housekeeping for the image library's cache folder (image_cache_file.h names its layout):
// <cache root>\<folder key>\*.img and sets.lst. Everything here touches the disk, so it runs
// on the writer's worker (image_cache_writer.h) and nowhere else.
//
//   Tidy  at start: keeps the current folder and the newest other one (a folder is as new as
//         its newest file) and deletes the rest of the root; removes the temp files of game
//         instances that are gone; then trims the kept folders to the size cap.
//   Clear deletes everything in the root (the "Clear image cache" option).
//   Touch marks a file as used, which is what "least recently used" means below.
//
// Least recently used is the file's last-write time. Nothing reads the clock per frame: a
// file gets a new time when it is written, and Touch gives it one when it is used again (the
// writer calls it for an image that is already on disk, and whatever reads a file back calls
// it on a hit). The cap pass deletes the oldest *.img files first, from the older kept
// folder before the current one.
//
// A file or folder that cannot be deleted (another game instance has it open, or a scanner
// does) is skipped without a word and tried again at the next start.
