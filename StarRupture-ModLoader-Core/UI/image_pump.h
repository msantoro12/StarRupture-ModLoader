// The image library's pump: once per engine tick it takes the next request
// from the table, finds or loads the texture, starts the read, and publishes
// the copy when the GPU has finished it.
//
// Everything that touches the engine or the GPU is behind Host, so the rules
// here (the budget per tick, what each read result does, eviction, device loss,
// shutdown) are testable with fakes. The loader's own Host is in
// image_pump_host.cpp.
//
// An item request waits in the pump until the item index knows its icon, and
// then becomes the image of the icon's texture path (Library::Alias).
//
// The sets (items, buildings): when a plugin uses a set and the loader's
// preload setting is on, the pump reads the set's list from the game, a slice
// per tick, and registers its images with the library. Preload then reads them
// in the background under the rules in the constants below.
//
// The disk cache (image_disk.h): the pump asks the source for every image first. An image with
// a file is read, checked and uploaded on the source's worker, never on the game thread, and is
// published like a shrunk copy. No game image is read and no package is loaded for it. Saved item
// names are tied to their texture paths when the folder is opened, and a saved set list fills the
// set without reading the game's list. While the folder is being listed the game side waits.
//
// Game thread only. The pump keeps no pointer into the engine: a texture is
// found, read and forgotten inside one Host::Read call.
